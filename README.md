# Django-Ecommerce
Hi,
This is a Python-Django Ecommerce project created in a smartphone using Termux and Acode editor.
Never have i ever thought it would be possible to create a Full Stack Project in a smartphone. where there is a will there is a way i guess.

This ecommerce website is done in a Cyberpunk theme mainly inspired by cyberpunk 2077 game and cyberpunk movies i watched adn learned from.

if you are a student or anyone who wants my project please do take it but know this:
    this project is made in a smartphone and there are a lot of tweekings done to make it possible so if you are cloning and runnning this project keep that in mind.
    There is a monkeypatch.py in this project right below settings.py. and in settings.py in the last line there is a line saying
    -import monkeypatch
    delete that line and the monkeypatch.py file if you want to run it in a pc or laptop.
